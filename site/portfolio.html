					<h4>Market Driven</h4>
					<p>The Dwight Hall socially responsible investment (SRI) fund at Yale is the first undergraduate-run SRI fund in the country. Our committee consists of 20 Yale College students who manage a portion of the endowment of Dwight Hall. We employ a modern approach to socially responsible investing (SRI) that aims to have a positive environmental and social impact while outperforming standard investment benchmarks. It is our hope that our portfolio will contribute to the success of Dwight Hall, inspire the creation of similar funds at other colleges, and make SRI both accessible and exciting to college students.</p>

					<h4>Mission Driven</h4>
					<p>Our Market Driven Portfolio invests through socially responsible funds in public companies, debt, and real estate. Our fund managers engage with their investments to improve the environmental, social, and corporate governance practices of some the largest and most powerful corporations in the world. Importantly, these funds have the same level of risk and return as traditional investments, in many cases outperforming their standard investment benchmarks.</p>


					<div class="page-header"><h2 id="Reports">Annual Reports</h2></div>
					<p>The following annual reports concern our market driven portfolio. We recognize that the some of our mission driven goals (e.g. investing in the New Haven community) often do not have readily measurable or quantifiable rates of return. As such, it would be difficult to prepare a report for our mission driven portfolio using similar methods. We are currently working on alternative metrics to measure our mission driven portfolio's success.</p>
